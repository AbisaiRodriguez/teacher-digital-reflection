                <p>As a teacher, I believe that all students have the right to learn and reach their full potential, no matter what their circumstance may be. I understand that all students are unique, and learn in different ways. My goal will be to provide and nurture a learning environment in which all students feel safe, cared for, and challenged to always reach their full potential.

                    In my classroom, I will always encourage students to share their ideas and nurture a growth mindset. I will strive to remind students that every time they try new and hard tasks, their brain is growing. I will present students with a curriculum that incorporates collaborative learning, hands on activities, and technology. I will always try my best to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all of my students, and incorporate their interests into their learning for engagement. I believe that all students have a right to learn, and have fun while theyâ€™re doing it.
